<p>Graduating from Bachelor of Science Degree major in Computing Science in University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.</p>
<p>One of my fouth year research is about Image Splicing. Image Splicing Detection can be combated using conventional machine learning methods. Although the literature registers good results on specific databases, whether they generalize on unseen data is still an issue. Our research is to investigate this generalization issue. We propose a Mixture of Experts based method to deal with the generalization problem. The approach uses unsupervised learning to clusterize the data and weighted averages of SVM trained on each cluster for classification. Our experiments suggest that it generalizes better over databases than the direct application of usual methods.</p>

<h1>July 2009</h1>
<p>I received Bachelor of Management Degree major in Tourism Management in Zhaoqing University, P.R.China.</p>
<p>My undergraduate research paper is titled "Exploration of Urban Recreational Culture District: a Case Study of Shamian Island, Guangzhou, P.R.China". This paper tries to put forward the new theory Recreational Culture District (RCD) in the background of Recreational Business District Theory (RBD), and choose Shamian as example. The concept RCD is originally raised by my supervisor Professor Xilin Zhang and this paper is the first research to finalize the concept and put it into practice.</p>
