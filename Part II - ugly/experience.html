<h1>Image Splicing Detection Research</h1>
<p>Image Splicing Detection can be combated using conventional machine learning methods. Although the literature registers good results on specific databases, whether they generalize on unseen data is still an issue. </p>
<p>In this research the generalization power of an Image Splicing Detection technique was
investigated. We propose a Mixture of Experts based method to deal with the generalization problem. The approach uses unsupervised learning to clusterize the data and weighted averages of SVM trained on each cluster for classification. Our experiments suggest that it generalizes better over databases than the direct application of usual methods.</p>          </div>

<h1>Doctor-Patient Web-based Application</h1>
<p>I was team member of a project to build a web-based database application system called Radiology Information System.</p>
<p>A Radiology Information System (RIS) is a computer information system that stores and
processes the information for a radiology lab, including all the data regarding patients, and all medical images generated by various diagnostic and therapeutic equipments</p>
<p>Our RIS contain modules such as login module, user management module, report generating module, uploading module and search module. All of them together provides specific functionalities for different classes of users such as admin, patient, doctor and radiologist.</p>

<h1>"Knight, Knave, Normal" Problem</h1>
<p>
"Knights, Knaves, Normals" is a logic puzzle where Knights are truthful and Knaves are lying but Normals can be both. The goal is to ask question to determine the road to destination.</p>
<p>
In my work, I designed a optimized question set to grow a decision tree with minimum height to find the destination. More interesting and challenging I used Haskell which is a type of non-procedural language to solve this problem.

<h1>Twitter-like System</h1>
<p>A twitter-like system in which each user can post twits, follow and unfollow other user and so on. This is done by building an information retrieval system, using the Berkeley DB library for operating on files and indices. The system keeps data in files and maintain indices that provide basic searches over data. This project address the knowledge of working with data in the physical layer rather than user interface design.</p>

<h1>Mountain-car Problem</h1>
<p>Mountain Car problem, a standard testing domain in reinforcement learning, in which an under-powered car must drive up a steep hill. Since gravity is stronger than the car's engine, even at full throttle, the car cannot simply accelerate up the steep slope. The car is situated in a valley and must learn to leverage potential energy by driving up the opposite hill before the car is able to make it to the goal at the top of the rightmost hill.</p>
<p>In our team project, we use SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) algorithm as unsupervised learning method to train the agent to achieve this goal.</p>
